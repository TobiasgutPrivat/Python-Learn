"""
Context:
We have a set of patients, each with a severity score from 1 to 10. We want to sort them
so that higher-severity patients are prioritized for care. We'll implement a simple
insertion sort (descending order) and compare its performance against Python's built-in
sorted() function.

Exercise:
Resolve all the TODOs.

Note:
Insertion sort has O(n^2) worst-case complexity, while Python’s built-in sorted() uses
“Timsort” with a typical worst-case of O(n log n). For large lists, the built-in sort
should be significantly faster.
